Source uploaded to github, working on automatic version creation and
packaging

0.5.3
1. Bugfixes.
- In some cases WanMark was marking your character not in group, in private mode
with automarking on. Fixed.

- Handling of events improved: when auto-mode is activated, WanMarks initiates marking.
So after "/wmode on" no need to push "/wmode mark" anymore.

2. Improvements.
- commands to change marks for healer and tank in public mode added
	/wmark tank 4
	/wmark healer 1

- work with command line improved.
Possibility to use marks names instead of numbers added.
The marks names to use are:
	none star circle diamond triangle moon square cross skull
The next two commands do the same now:
	/wmark 6 mycharacter1 mycharacter2
	/wmark square mycharacter1 mycharacter2
Also the next two change the chosen mark for tank to be the red cross:
	/wmark tank 7
	/wmark tank cross
So you don't need to remember numbers anymore.

- Output of command "/wmark show" changed, depending if public or private mode is current.
In public mode only tank and healer currently saved marks are shown:
	WanMark public mode marks:
	  Tank mark is triangle [4]
	  Healer mark is star [1]
In private mode all saved lists of marks/characters are shown:
	WanMark private mode marks:
	  none [0]: <empty or characters list>
	  star [1]: <empty or characters list>
	  circle [2]: <empty or characters list>
	  diamond [3]: <empty or characters list>
	  triangle [4]: <empty or characters list>
	  moon [5]: <empty or characters list>
	  square [6]: <empty or characters list>
	  cross [7]: <empty or characters list>
	  skull [8]: <empty or characters list>
